### Soybean Budget Tool  
The Maryland soybean budget was developed using average yields and estimated input cost based upon producer and farm supplier data. The default numbers are averages and are not official recommendations, actual values will vary greatly between operations. It is therefore crucial to input actual farm data when completing enterprise budgets for your farm. Make changes to these values to include your production techniques, inputs and overall management.  
  
Once you have customized the values to reflect your operation, click the "Generate report" button to save your budget as a pdf document. Information entered by users is NOT saved on the server, and is only saved locally on the user's computer by clicking the "Generate report" button.
